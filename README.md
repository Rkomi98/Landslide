# Landslide Project
 In this project we have analyzed the risk of landslides in the city of Como and its surroundings.
As software we used QGis and a tool of R to implement the Random forest on our data.
You can see in this repository the webpage code. If you download it and you open the index.html, you can see all our procedure and the outcomes of our project.
We would like to offer our special thanks to our tutors, Daniele Oxoli, Vasil Yordanov and Juan Francisco Toro.
